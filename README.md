# PoetCode
A couple simple tools to write radical poetry.

This is mostly a personal experiment in radical poetry, but I hope to expand it into a set of tools for radical poets.

To that end, it is licensed. Everything applicable in this repository is covered by the Cooperative Non-Violent Public License. The full text is available in the LICENSE file, and more general information is available at https://thufie.lain.haus/NPL.html. This does not include the dictionary files; these were borrowed from a class I took, but I've found them elsewhere as well. By this I assume they are free to use.
