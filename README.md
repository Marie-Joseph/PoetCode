# PoetCode
A couple simple tools to write radical poetry.

This is mostly a personal experiment in radical poetry, but I hope to expand it into a set of tools for radical poets.

As this is a personal experiment, at the moment I won't be accepting any code contributions. However, I'd encourage you to clone this repo and run the .py file a few times (no more than three, preferably). This will automatically create time-stamped poems in the poems directory, then you can open a pull request and they'll be added to the collection. If you do so, please do leave an email where you can be reached in case I ever want to use the poems for something.

For when the project is finished, it is licensed. Everything applicable in this repository is covered by the Cooperative Non-Violent Public License. The full text is available in the LICENSE file, and more general information is available at https://thufie.lain.haus/NPL.html. This does not include the dictionary files; these were borrowed from a class I took, but I've found them elsewhere as well. By this I assume they are free to use.
