# PoetCode
A couple simple tools to write radical poetry.

This is mostly a personal experiment in radical poetry, but I hope to expand it into a set of tools for radical poets.

As this is a personal experiment, at the moment I won't be accepting any code contributions. However, I'd encourage you to clone this repo and run either program a few times. This will automatically create time-stamped poems in the poems directory, then you can open a pull request and they'll be added to the collection. If you do so, please do leave an email where you can be reached in case I ever want to use the poems for something.

As far as I can tell, neither version will write properly on Windows as-is, but simply changing file path formatting should fix.
